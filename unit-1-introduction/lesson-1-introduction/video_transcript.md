Welcome to our Flask Tutorial. This is a step-by-step guide that will walk you through the process of creating a real-life Python-powered website using the Flask web framework. 

We'll start really simple, setting up the environment of our application and we'll go up to including the static files databases and template inheritance.

Hello my name is Santiago and I'm an instructor at RMOTR.com 

RMOTR is an online programming boot camp specializing in Python, web development, and data science.

At RMOTR you have real classes with real teachers and classmates, but you do it from the comfort of your home.

As we always say you won't be a pro basketball player just by sitting and watching the NBA; you gotta go out and practice. 

The same thing happens with programming: the only way to learn is by sitting and coding.

Of course, that's hard to do just by yourself. That's why we've built an online boot camp guided by a real people willing to help you.

Flask is one of the most popular piped in web frameworks. It's used worldwide to power Cork top-level websites like Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Reddit. 

It's also one of the most popular choices to create RESTful APIs to interact with mobile devices and the Internet of Things. 

The reason we created this course is that we saw our own students struggling over and over with the same topics.

Setting up an application, understanding the concept behind HTTP, taking your first step with Flask, among many others.

So we decided it was a good idea to put it all together in the form of a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial.

As we also do with our courses we will focus on teaching concepts so you can then apply them to other web frameworks and technologies. 

This is where I'll start by explaining to you the foundations behind how the web works and HTTP, the protocol behind the internet.

We will also walk you through the process of setting up your own environment using Cloud9, installing Flask dependencies, and kickstarting your own app. 

This tutorial is divided into a set of comprehensive steps that start from the most basic Flask app you can build and goes as far as connecting to a real SQL database, working with statis files, and templates. 

All the concepts that you need to create your own web application. 

Finally, if you're doing this course in our free platform, learn.rmotr.com, you'll have access to explanations and summaries for each video.

Transcripts and real coding exercises hosted on GitHub, where you can fork the repo, solve the assignment using Cloud9, and push your solution to keep building your own personal portfolio.

If you're a student at RMOTR you will have access to mentors and instructors in case you have questions at any part of this tutorial.

Let's get started building a real live application using Python and Flask, and don't forget to check out our courses at rmotr.com.
